Walkthrough for different modes:

Development Firebase
run cd android && ./gradlew signingReport.
Copy the SHA-1 hash and paste it into the firebase console under Android in Project Settings.
Download the google-services.json file from the Firebase settings and paste the file into android/app
Use the client client_type: 3 clientId inside the config.

The below commands worked for me ...

1. cd android
